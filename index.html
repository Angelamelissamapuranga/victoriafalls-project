            <h2>The famous Mosi-oa-Tunya</h2>
            <p>
              Victoria Falls is one of the most breathtaking natural attractions
              on Earth, located on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe in Southern
              Africa. Known locally as “Mosi-oa-Tunya”, meaning “The Smoke That
              Thunders,” the falls are famous for their immense width, powerful
              water flow, and mist that can be seen from miles away. It is one
              of the largest and most iconic waterfalls in the world and a
              UNESCO World Heritage Site.

              Victoria Falls is a famous natural waterfall located on the border
              of Zambia and Zimbabwe in Southern Africa. It is locally known as
              Mosi-oa-Tunya, meaning “The Smoke That Thunders,” a name inspired
              by the mist and sound created by the falling water. The falls are
              one of the largest in the world and are recognized as a UNESCO
              World Heritage Site. Visitors are often drawn to Victoria Falls
              for its powerful scenery and peaceful surroundings. The area
              offers walking paths with scenic viewpoints, views of the Zambezi
              River, and opportunities to experience local culture and wildlife
              nearby. Depending on the season, the mist, rainbows, and water
              flow create very different but equally memorable views. Victoria
              Falls is often remembered not just for its size, but for the
              feeling of being close to nature and witnessing something truly
              remarkable.
